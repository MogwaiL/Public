***
As we can see, from season 2007/2008 to season 2017/2018, revenues show only a minimal advantage for Manchester City. However, as we shall see with some upcoming visualizations, the trend would indicate a growing advantage for Manchester City.

On the other hand, transfer spending has been heavily tilted in favour of Manchester City since season 2007/2008.

A note on sources:
Revenue data is based on Deloitte Football Money League publications and can be viewed [HERE](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html)

Transfer data is collated from multiple sources; primarily https://www.transfermarkt.com/ and https://www.transferleague.co.uk/.

A good deal of inspiration that started us on this project came from https://github.com/ewenme who did a fine job scraping transfermarkt. We will definitely be going back to that dataset for future analysis. His football repo can be viewed at https://github.com/ewenme/footy-transfer-data
